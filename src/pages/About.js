      <p>
      I am becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in the
        Multi-Family Property Management field. Currently, I am taking
        full-stack web development course in the University of Washington Coding
        Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, HTML,
        ExpressJS, SQL, Mongo Database, and many other Node npm packages. Most
        recently I worked on a team of four to develop a website that utilized
        different APIs, MYSQL database, and AWS S3 bucket. We collaborated with
        the team on GitHub to build different branches of the project on our
        local machine and merged them into the main branch. I was able to apply
        my problem solving, organization, and strong written/oral communication
        skills which helped ensure the team stayed on track to meet deadlines.
        Iâ€™m excited to put my skills to work as part of a fast-paced and
        quality-driven team.
